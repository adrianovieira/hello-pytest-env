= Simple FastAPI app

== pytest + environ-config

The app needs a environment variable, e.g: APP_PLACE and it can have different values depending on the context it is running on.

.main app
[source, python]
----
include::app/main.py[]
----

.environ-config app
[source, python]
----
include::app/config.py[]
----

What if the app needs the environment variable, e.g: APP_PLACE and its values could be `EU`, `AMERICAS`, `AFRICA`, `ASIA`, etc?

.Test cases trying some approach to check values
[source, python]
----
include::tests/Hello_test.py[]
----

If one runs those test cases individually - it works well.

But it doesn't work if one runs all tests because _pytest_ or _environ-config_ only loads APP_* variables once from the (O.S.)environment.
